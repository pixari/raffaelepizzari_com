                  I truly believe in the <strong>value of sharing knowledge</strong>. <br>
                  That's why I enjoy contributing to <strong>open source projects</strong>, supporting some junior developers as <strong>mentor</strong> and giving <strong>free talks</strong> about technical topics.
